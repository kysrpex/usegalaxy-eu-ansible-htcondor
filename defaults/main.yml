    # condor_collector
    ########
    # The default maximum age in seconds for ClassAds collected by the condor_collector.
    # ClassAds older than the maximum age are discarded by the condor_collector as stale. It is defined in seconds.

    # condor_negotiator
    ########
    # Sets how often the condor_negotiator starts a negotiation cycle. It is defined in seconds.
    # NEGOTIATOR_INTERVAL = 60
    # This macro determines how often the condor_negotiator daemon sends a ClassAd update to the condor_collector. It is defined in seconds.

    # condor_master

    # condor_schedd
    ########
    # This macro determines the maximum interval for both how often the condor_schedd sends a ClassAd update to the
    # condor_collector and how often the condor_schedd daemon evaluates jobs. It is defined in terms of seconds
    # SCHEDD_INTERVAL = 300
    # This integer-valued macro works together with the JOB_START_COUNT macro to throttle job starts.
    # The condor_schedd daemon starts $(JOB_START_COUNT) jobs at a time, then delays for $(JOB_START_DELAY) seconds
    # before starting the next set of jobs. This setting is defined in terms of seconds
    # JOB_START_DELAY = 0
    # This macro works together with the JOB_START_DELAY macro to throttle job starts.
    # The default and minimum values for this integer configuration variable are both 1.
    # JOB_START_COUNT = 1

    # Determines how often the condor_startd should send a ClassAd update to the condor_collector.  It is defined in terms of seconds
